# Master Thesis Project

This project is part of my master's thesis and involves processing data provided in CSV files. The implementation utilizes Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration and PostgreSQL for data storage, all containerized using Docker.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source:** CSV files
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Apache Airflow
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Security

For security purposes, usernames and passwords for these applications are managed through environment variables.

## Implementation Details

The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Airflow is implemented using Python classes to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AmirrezaKha/Thesis_airflow.git
   cd Thesis_airflow
